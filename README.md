# Demonstration project for i18next

This is a basic project used to demonstrate how to setup internationalisation (i18n) in a React project using
[i18next](https://www.i18next.com/) and [react-i18next](https://react.i18next.com/).

A step by step guide on how the i18n code in this repository works can be found in our blog post
[Internationalisation with react-i18next](https://jgtech.uk/blog/2023/01/02/internationalisation-with-react-i18next).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation

To build and start this project, run the following:

`npm i && npm start`

The project should be available in browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
